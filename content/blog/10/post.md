We decided to double down on our open source efforts without knowing how we can make it sustainable. Open-source software is accessible for free, so how would you make money with it?

Too many open source projects die because developers burn out to deliver fantastic software in their free time. That’s not how it should be, so we researched the topic and concluded there is not that one answer to the question.

It depends on your project’s type, what you want to do, and who you develop the software for. Here is a compiled list of things you can consider to make money with your open-source projects and hopefully make the development sustainable. You can even combine multiple ideas.

## Donations
The easiest way to ask people for money is donations. Sadly, just that doesn’t work well. We tried to ask for donations for tiptap, a popular package that took us a few hundred hours to develop.

Through tiptap is used by tons of developers and even a few big corporations, we earned less than $300 through PayPal donations over the last years. Don’t get me wrong, we are very thankful for every dollar, but this makes an hourly rate of less than $1. That’s not sustainable.

Side Note: If you think we just placed the PayPal button on the wrong spot. No, I don’t think that was the fault. We even tried to reach out to a company that uses tiptap in their software and has an annual recurring revenue of more than $100,000,000 to ask them for a $500 donation (0,0005 % of their yearly income). I never received an answer to any of my messages.

## Licenses
Though your source code is open source, you can add a license that requires developers to pay for permission to use it in their projects. And to keep it fair, you can exclude non-commercial projects and non-profit organizations.

Note, it might be hard to enforce the license for publicly accessible source code.

## Support
There will always be developers and companies in need of support to use your software. You can offer support contracts, e. g. to promise a short response time or availability for calls. Some companies require this level of support, even if they’ll never use it.

It can be a distraction from the work they’re good at it for single developers but can work well for teams.

## Contracting
If you open-sourced something complex, companies might want to hire you to help to implement your solution in their system. They know that you are the expert for the software you’ve written and happily pay you, even if it’s more than an average freelancer rate.

If you enjoy open-source because you didn’t want to work with clients, that’s probably not for you.

On the other hand, you’ll always use your code, which will help get insights into how your software can be improved to make the integration easier.

## Dual licensing
Consider having different licenses for your software. A basic version of your software can be free for everyone, while another version, probably more tailored to what companies need, can be licensed differently.

You’ll still receive contributions for the free software, but keep the advanced version closed. Keep in mind that maintaining different versions of software in parallel is more complicated.

## Freemium
Also, consider offering a free version for everyone and add a few benefits for professional use that are only available for paying users.

Those extra benefits can be access to more features/plugins or other things like a community with restricted access.

## Managed Hosting
If your software needs hosting and can be self-hosted, consider offering a managed hosting solution. Many people don’t want to operate their instance and happily pay you to do that for them.

You need to develop something to sell it, provision new instances, and maintain them. It’s a very fair approach and can work well, as you’ll always have people paying for convenience.

## Sponsorship
There are so many platforms tailored to easily offer sponsorship subscriptions to your users that you should think about adding this. But be aware that it’s the same as with donations. You won’t get many sponsors, but it’s recurring revenue that can help you feel safe.

## Sponsorware
With Sponsorware, you can offer your sponsors an added value, giving them access to private repositories. People always ask to receive early access to things that they expect to be valuable for them.

When you reach a certain number of sponsors, you can decide to open source the project and make it available to everyone. It will help if you start new projects regularly then.

## Audience
You can use your open source work as marketing for yourself and build up an audience. It takes time and doesn’t make you money from that alone, but can work very well if you use social media anyway.

An audience is only the chance to sell something additional. You’re probably in a great position because you know what your followers need. But know that it’s a lot of extra work on top of your open source projects.

## Education
You’re the expert for your software, so I’d want to learn more about your software. I prefer to get that educational content from you. Consider publishing an ebook or a video course that explains your software in all details and helps people use it.

## Ads
If you’ve got widespread documentation with thousands of page views every month, you’ll be able to put ads on it and earn money with that.

It’s not what we like to do because it’s little money to sell people’s privacy using your software. That said, some companies try to take an ethical approach to ads.

## Shop
If your software has a brand and people identify with it, a shop might work well for you. You can sell stickers, shirts, caps, posters, and whatnot.

Those products still cost you money, so you’ll only earn a part of what the customer pays for the product.

## Products
Maybe you have a software that can be the foundation for a whole ecosystem. Then you have the chance to add commercial products to the universe of your software.

People will buy your products because you’ll tailor them precisely for the software you built in the first place.

## Paid Certifications
If companies are looking for developers with knowledge of your software, you can certify developers’ abilities. But if you already reached that level of popularity, you probably don’t need that post here anyway.

That said, we’ll hope that your open source project gains popularity and the list of things you can do somehow helps you make the maintenance and development sustainable.

Let’s face it—nobody profits from abandoned open source projects.

That’s all we could find, but I’m sure we missed something. Please point out other ways to your open source work sustainable. Let’s make open source sustainable together!
