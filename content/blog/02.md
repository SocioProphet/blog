It’s the same thing as always. I started a blog, and it has a few posts, that’s it. You all added this to your feed reader (decentralization, cool!), but none of you will get a new post to your inbox anyway.

## No, I can’t take it anymore.
I want to write. I’d love to share what we are working on, what we do differently, what we are struggling with, and what we learn on our way. I want the posts in our blog to pile up. I want to look at it and think, “Wow, when did we write all those posts?”

It’s not that I don’t write. I actually write a ton every day, and I even write blog posts. It’s just that they are stuck in my draft folder.

## Publishing a blog post makes me feel insecure.
It’s my thoughts but in a very official way. If I would actually hit publish, it would stand there, somewhere on the Internet. And we all know that it won’t be for everyone. There will be mistakes, there will be people with different opinions, there will be people hating the things I write (just because or for a reason). Some will call me arrogant (look, he has a blog!). At least that’s what I expect.

But I want to do this. For the few people that take value out of it and just for me. So how can I convince myself to not only write regularly but also hit publish in the end?

## I’ll try something new.
Here it is: I’m going to publish one post every single day for 30 days. Monday to Friday. Can’t be that hard, can it?
