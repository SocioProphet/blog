Too many open source developers abandon their projects because they canâ€™t sustain their work. Funding the development, maintenance, and support of an open source project is challenging but possible. Letâ€™s find out together how this can work for tiptap.

## The community
There is a significant advantage to make such thoughts for tiptap. And this advantage is you. With so many people know, like, use and contribute to tiptap, we have a strong foundation to start [developing tiptap 2](/post/our-plan-for-tiptap-2/) confidently.

We hope to make everything as transparent as our codebase and look forward to your contributions to the projectâ€™s thinking. We are in this together, arenâ€™t we?

## The idea
After evaluating [a few different ways to monetize an open source project](/post/monetizing-open-source/) and having strong opinions against a few of them, we focused on one idea. Internally, we refer to it as tiptap pro.

Nothing is defined here, not even the name. However, there is a rough idea of it. First of all, let us be clear with that:

**The whole codebase is going to stay open and accessible for everyone. No matter where you come from or what you plan to do, you should be able to start your project with tiptap.**

On top of that, we want to provide professional users, developers, and companies who make money with tiptap with additional, valuable benefits. Those benefits, and only those, will require your sponsorship.

### #1 Professional extensions
The power of tiptap is its extensibility, and with tiptap 2 we will double down on that. The new version will start with fewer extensions, but we plan to add many more extensions to it with time.

A few of those extensions are complicated to build, have complex requirements, will probably need more maintenance and support, and are likely to be used in a professional context.

With tiptap pro, weâ€™d like to ask people who use those extensions in a commercial product to sponsor the further development, maintenance, and support of those extensions.

### #2 Highlighted issues
From now on, all issues and pull requests created by sponsors of our organization will automatically get a sponsor ðŸ’– label attached. Itâ€™s just a tiny change but helps us make extra sure to jump in those contributions as soon as possible and support the people who support us.

That said, we hope to get funding for the development to a level that makes it possible to put enough time into the project, to help everyone quickly, professionally, and equally.

### ~~#3 Closed community~~
We already started to invite very few people to chat with us in private ways, which is fantastic for our current development phase. There is still much work to be done to show what weâ€™ve got to more people. Nevertheless, we are very proud of the parts weâ€™ve tackled already. Considering precise and constructive feedback from the teams familiar with the current version of tipap is valuable for us and everyone waiting for the new version.

That said, nothing we do should be private. We want everything to be open, transparent, and accessible, and a closed community wonâ€™t. While we think it could give a great benefit for a few users, we donâ€™t believe the community would benefit from it equally.
