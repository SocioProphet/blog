In direct comparison with the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions, we’re obviously much better off. As a team of twelve, we spend most of the time on laptops in our Berlin office, where we don’t have a significant amount of livestock (or none at all). But since there’s always room for improvement, our mighty in-house sustainability officers Kris and Niklas evaluated our agency’s carbon footprint to implement green(er) solutions. Easy. Right?

## Commute

The majority of our team goes to work by bike or public transport, while a few of us use the daily commute for a stroll through the city. However, three people are relying on cars to get to work and produce about three tons of CO₂ per year.

## Office

We’re using carbon-neutral providers for our websites and domains. But heating is inevitable during Berlin winters, and that makes for more than 4 tons of CO₂ per year.

## Travel

Our annual workations serve as an opportunity to escape the day-to-day work routine while setting ourselves new goals in team workshops. On our most recent trip to Spain, we’ve decided unanimously to prioritize a sustainable office. Still, our flights to Barcelona resulted in almost 8 tons of CO₂ emissions, additional to regular business trips this year.

That leaves us with about 32.4 tons of CO₂ in 2019. If this number doesn’t seem daunting already, let’s visualize its equivalent of 16.491.600 liters: So based on an average balloon’s volumetric capacity of 2.5 liters, our annual CO₂ output equals 6,596,640 balloons.

**Fuck.**
