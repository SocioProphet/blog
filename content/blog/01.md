# Protect Nothing, Share Everything

All our apps will be open source. Even the ones that we sell licenses for. There is nothing we won’t share with you. So why are we doing this?

## Here is how everyone is doing it

We built two apps, both for macOS. One to learn keyboard shortcuts[1] and the other one to quickly find unicode characters[2]. Both were sold a few thousand times and it felt like a huge success.

But something felt off. People asked us to contribute new keyboard shortcuts, to fix issues, or to add more tags to the character database. Yes, that’s something we have to do. It’s our code, isn’t it?

And then there were the people that had problems activating their license. We use Gumroad to sell licenses to those apps and while the selling part works fine, the “license management” is a joke. No way to reset a license, increase allowed uses, disable devices. Not even a way to generate a new license key. People setting up their new MacBook couldn’t activate their license, they had to contact us. We had to do a test purchase to get a license and send them the license, that then was attached to our account.

Anyway, we are developers. The solution is easy: We have to develop our own license management system. But it that word stuck in my head. license. management. system. I remembered younger me, someone who downloaded photoshop, edited the host file to block Adobe from checking the license. I learned so much from free resources and cracked software. I’m pretty thankful for all of that, it even led me to my job.

So why do I - the older me - invest time to protect our code so other’s cant see it. Why do I keep my hand above the things I built? Why do I invest time in a license management system. This type of system I tried to block as a teenager.

It’s not how I think the world should be. I want to live in a world where as much as possible is shared. A world where learning ressources are available for free. Where software is free for kids (and other people without income). I’m thankful for platforms like GitHub that makes it possible to easily share code with thousands or even millions of other people. Code is digital, it doesn’t cost a thing when someone copies those digital resources to use it. Why should I bother then?

So that led us to a question: What if we won’t protect anything, what if public is our new default?

## A new default

Let’s have a look at the risks we face making everything public:

**Maybe people won’t buy our apps anymore.** Sure, that’s possible. They can go to the repository, set up their local development setup, pay $99 for an Apple developer account (to sign & notarize the app) and build their own version locally. Or they pay a few dollars to get the latest release from us. Let’s be honest, I don’t think that impact on our sales will be measurable.

**Maybe people would rip our code and sell it.** Maybe! I hope people are more creative than ripping our code. But if they do, I can’t imagine they’ll make a noteworthy amount of money. And even if they do, I don’t think that we’ll make us less money then.

**Maybe people would create issues, ask questions and send PRs**. Hell yeah, that would be amazing. It’s time consuming to manage that, but I don’t think it will be more than a few hours a month. And what’s better than other people improving your work? People that ask us to contribute new shortcuts to Mouseless or new tags to Glyphfinder will be able to do just that from now on. I think that’s amazing.

Okay, so I’m not a professional risk analyst and maybe my imagination is limited, but I’d say we can handle this. So let’s have a look at alle the good things that could happen:

**Maybe people use our code to learn something. Maybe people learn how we make money with our apps and sell their own apps. Maybe people will point out issues in our code. Maybe people will find security issues. Maybe people will contribute new content or new features.**

There is even one more important point. An interesting thing happens when you make things public and people can transparently see what you’re doing. It’s the same when your mother visits you. You finally clean up. You look through the things you publish and try to see it with other eyes.

For code that means you'll update the dependencies, you’ll fix broken tests, you’ll remove the TODO comments. Does your app secretly track data? Does your app send data to an API? Does your app access the computer without the users knowing it? You won’t publish that kind of code. You’ll see it with the eyes of the users and wouldn’t publish anything that’s not in the interest of the user.

And I think that’s a great way to make software more friendly, more privacy-aware, more reliable and more secure. So let’s do it, here is the Glyphfinder repository: https://github.com/ueberdosis/glyphfinder Dig through the code, learn new things, point out issues or send PRs. We’re looking forward

The same applies not only to code, but to other areas aswell. We’re all in. We’ll share everything – not only our code – with you. No secrets.
